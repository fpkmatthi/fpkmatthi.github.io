I am Matthias Van De Velde, a <span id="age"></span> years old student at Ghent University College. I am currently in the final year of my bachelor education in Applied Computer Science. Earlier this year, I got the opportunity to attend a 3 day CISA bootcamp, organized by ISACA.

After I have obtained my degree, I plan to persue the field of cyber security.
Firstly, I'd go for certificates with more hands-on experience and later transfer to a more high-level view of the field.
I've got my eye on certificates from SANS and ISACA.

Besides my interests in cyber security, I am very passionate when it comes to learning new things. Whenever I get the chance, I work on improving my skills and broadening my knowledge.

In my spare time I volunteer at the NPO Sisters of Saint Vincent de Paul of Opwijk, where I act as a 1st and 2nd line support for the residents.
